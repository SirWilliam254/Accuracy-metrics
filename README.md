# Accuracy-metrics
After model fitting it is usually of interest to assess how well it can predict data which it has not seen before hand(during training).
By comparing model's predictions and the actual data.
## Accuracy
This is the raio of correct predictions to total predictions.

```r
accuracy = correct_pred / total_pred
```
